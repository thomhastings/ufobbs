witness is a Sunday School teacher.

her house and the woods lit up just as if it were daytime.  She could see 
shadows being cast of whatever it was but not the object itself as it was 
directly overhead.  She did not go out to investigate.  The lighting effect 
lasted for about five seconds.  There was no sound.

Bright lights hovering over Green Mountain Reservoir and Kremmling...
 
Twenty-plus calls to the Summit County sheriff... 
 
And sightings by the sheriff's department and the police departments of Dillon 
and Silverthorne. 
 
Science fiction?  Even after seeing them, Kremmling police officer Scott  Koch 
would like to believe it is. 
 
On Sunday, April 20, a call came into the Kremmling PD from the Summit County 
sheriff's department, reporting numerous UFO sightings and inquiring if any 
similar calls had been received in Kremmling. 
 
Koch, who was on the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift that night, saw stationary, colored 
lights in the skies directly over Kremmling.  He then was informed of sightings 
near Green Mountain Reservoir, and drove down Colo. 9 to the county line.  
 
There, a large group of law enforcement officers from Grand and Summit Counties 
was witnessing something stranger than fiction.  The lights were viewed over 
Williams Peak and the Gore, and through a high powered telescope, the objects 
looked to be triangular in shape, with lights on the outer edges.  They were 
observed to hover, then "take off" to the southwest. 
 
The most startling aspect of the occurrence was the evasive action of a jet 
plane, which all present saw veer around one of the objects.  Koch figured they 
watched for about two hours. 
 
Fact? Fiction?  These witnesses were trained ovservers, professional men who 
viewed something alien to their natures. 

They really don't want to talk about it. 
 
But they don't deny the fact that something truly strange was out that night.

Area police said aircraft in the skies last night promted several dozen calls 
to the Danbury and Brookfield police departments as well as to state police 
barracks in Southbury and in Brewster with reports of UFOs. 
 
State police at the Southbury barracks said the crafts were probably ultra-
light aircraft, but a New York sate trooper said they were regular planes 
"putting on a show."  
 
"They few right over the barracks, it was very impressive," said Trooper Peter 
Kontos of the Brewster barracks.  "If you didn't know what it was, I could see 
how you would think it was strange." 
 
Kontos said the barracks received a half-dozen calls and "a whole mess of 
people" who stopped at the barracks to point out the spectacle to troopers. 
 
He said the Stormville, N.Y., barracks notified police about the aircraft.  He 
said the pilots throttle the planes' engines to make it appear they are 
standing still, and then suddenly take off at a high speed. 
 
The Putnam County Sheriffs' Depatment, Brookfield police and Connecticut State 
Police at Troop A said they received a half-dozen calls each about the planes.  
Danbury police said they received 20 calls.

Forensics testing UFO evidence
 
Examiners at the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences will be testing the 
only evidence of a UFO which fell in Washington County in an effort to unravel 
the origin of the object which apparently exploded before it crashed into a 
backyard. 
 
It left trees and plants broken and damaged, but no clues as to what it was or 
what caused it. 
 
Mr. Jim Small, a trace evidence examiner with the Forensic Science lab who 
specializes in examining evidence from arson and explosions, said the lab 
received samples of the damaged plants and trees from the Washington County 
Sheriff's Department Wednesday. 
 
The first thing that we will look for is some type of explosive residue. Beyond 
that, I don't know, Small said. 

The explosion, which occured March 5 in the backyard of the Jesse Wallace 
Henson family in Frankville, was investigated by Washington County Sheriff 
William J. Wheat.  Wheat said he had no idea what caused it whether it was a 
land explosion or caused by something that fell from the sky.
