      LETTER FROM GENERAL N.F. TWINING TO COMMANDING GENERAL,    
 
               ARMY AIR FORCES 23 SEPTEMBER 1947  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
f.  It is possible within the present U.S. knowledger - provided 
    extensive detailed development is undertaken--to construct a piloted   
    aircraft which has the general description of the object in  
    subparagraph (e) above which would be capable of an approximate range  
    of 700 miles at subsonic speeds.    
 
g.  Any devlopments in this country along the lines indicated would be
    extremely expensive, time consuming and at the considerable expense    
    of current projects and therefore, if directed, should be set up  
    independently of existing projects. 
 
h.  Due consideration must be given the following:
 
    (1)  The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin - the   
         product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or
         this command.   
 
    (2)  The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered
         exhibits which would undeniably prove the existence of these 
         objects.   
 
    (3)  The possibility that some foreign nation has a form of  
         propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of our domestic
         knowledge. 
 
3.  It is recommended that:   
 
a.  Headquarters, Army Air Forces issue a directive assigning a priority,  
    security classification and code name for a detailed study of this
    matter to include the preparation of complete sets of all available    
    and pertinent data which will then be made available to the Army, 
    Navy, Atomic Energy Commission, JRDB, the Air Force Scientific    
    Advisory Group, NACA, and the RAND and NEPA projects for comments 
    and recommendations, with a preliminary report to be forwarded    
    within 15 days of receipt of the data and a detailed report  
    thereafter every 30 days as the investigation develops.  A complete    
    interchange of data should be effected.  
 
4.  Awaiting a specific directive AMC will continue the investigation 
    within its current resources in order to more closely define the  
    nature of the phenomenon.  Detailed Essential Elements of    
    Information will be formulated immediately for transmittal thru   
    channels.  
 
                                         N.F. TWINING  
                                         Lieutenant General, U.S.A.   
                                         Commanding.
