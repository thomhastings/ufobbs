Several people in Iowa County incluing the Sheriff have reported seeing a 
strange light in the sky Sunday night. 
 
But it may have been only an airplanes landing lights. 
 
Jean and Bob Ellarson of rural Barneveld, both experienced the sighting of the 
UFO Both said they saw the light while driving west on Zwetler Road in the town 
of Vermont at approximately 9:45 P.M. 
 
The light, Jean Ellarson said, didn't seem to be moving at all. They stop their 
car and rolled down a wondow. All of a sudden, the thing started coming toward 
us and I mean fast, she said. It was like a big bright star. There were no 
blinking lights, no red and green - like you might see on a plane - and there 
no noise It move very fast, then swung off toward highway 14. It has to be a 
UFO whatever that means, she said.  
 
Sheriff Nick Basting who spotted it from his patrol car south of Mineral point. 
I wouldn't swear to it, but I think it was an airplane with it landing light 
on.

Some witnesses in the Glendale area heard an explosion Sunday night and felt it 
shake their homes. Some witnesses reported that they observed a light of a low 
- flying object. 
 
What they saw and heard they believed to the crash of a plane or a helicopter.
 
Police and volunteers searched all night and monday morning and found no crash 
or explosion site. Several people saw whatever it was, do whatever it did, 
including a Sheriffs deputy. Police do not believe the report were the result 
of some kind of hoax. 
 
Sherri McGraw, a resident of Goldmine Road in Glendale, said she saw the thing 
flying low near the treetops. It had a big white light and smaller red lights 
on the front of it but she couldn't see its body. 
 
She saw it go behind the trees and hear it explode and it didn't come back up. 
Sherri said she doesn't believe what she saw was a hot air balloon. It moved 
very quick she said. A helicopter also search the area but did not find 
anything. 
 
The investigation is closed unless something new turns up.

collision.  After the pilots had leveled off, two objects turned around and 
started to follow their plane.  The pilot tried to use his radio and said it 
was unoperative due to heavy static.  The pilot described that one object was 
on one side of the wing and one on the other.  The objects then accelerated at 
phenomenal speeds heading due west in the direction of Seattle at which time

Saturday evening March 1, 1986 at approximately 8:30 P.M. the CUFON - UFO 
Information Service in Seattle, Washington and the National UFO Reporting 
Center started receiving calls of a UFO sighting in the direction of Payne 
Field.  Witnesses said that they had spotted these objects while driving on 
Interstate 5 near the north side of Mountlake Terrace.  The witnesses described 
that the objects were large in size,  although they could only see large 
lights.  When questioned further, they said the objects were the size of a 
quarter at arms length.  The witnesses said that there were nine objects total.  
They also said that small white and blue objects were dropping out of some of 
the larger objects but did not hit the ground, instead headed for the north at 
fast rates of speed.  When asked how many witnesses altogether there were, the 
witness described that he had counted fifteen cars pulled off to the side of 
the freeway observing the UFO's.  The total duration of the sighting was about 
30 minutes.  The larger objects were then seen heading north also in formation.  
At exactly 11:00 P.M. all three news networks in Seattle, Washington gave their 
account of the sighting.  All three had a different story.  One explanation 
given was that FAA said that Payne Field was having aerial maneuvers.  Another 
station said they called Payne Field and they stated it was possibly balloons.  
The next day after the sighting, CUFON called Payne Field and talked with 
Sargent Tinsley-Army Opera- tions.  She checked flight records for that evening 
and said that there were no military maneuvers going on at Payne Field at the 
date and time of the sighting.  She also stated that most of the time they do 
not have maneuvers going on after 9:00 P.M. because of noise levels. This is a 
highly residential area also. 
 
By coincidence there was a head on collision with two small single engine 
aircraft two weeks prior to this sighting.  Two witnesses observed two planes 
colliding overhead in the Black Diamond, Washington area.  The witnesses 
describ-ed the plane exploding in the air on im-pact then watched the small 
plane head towards the ground.  They said the other plane then went on its own 
way.  Although the witnesses said there were two planes, none of them were able 
to describe it accurately and the plane that departed was never found.  Two 
days later after the incident, a helicopter that was leased by photographers 
for National Geographics was found crashed.  The photographers were found dead 
in the helicopter near Mount Saint Helens. The reckage was found on flat ground 
with no reasonable explanation according to FAA. 
 
CUFON contacted FAA investigator to find out if they had any details on both 
accidents.  The FAA investigator told CUFON that the helicopter may have had a 
"whiteout".  When asked about the mid air collision with the two single engine 
aircraft, the FAA investigator said he didn't believe there was another plane 
involved.  This meant that he was disregarding the testimony of the witnesses.  
As to this date, there has been no wreckage found of the second aircraft.

Witness saw first small flashing red and white lights in distant northwest sky.
Then a very large, bright round white beam of light replaced the smaller ones.  
Came straight towards her home.  As it flew closer she opened her window to see 
better and barely heard anything, possibly the low hum of an engine.  It 
approached within an acre or less of the house and then veered slightly to the 
southwest, skimming over the treetops toward the Post Road and Long Island 
Sound.  Witness thought she saw a very large, completely darkened, elongated 
elliptical object about 50 to 100 feet long gliding over the trees.  Other 
listeners, area residents, were calling in to tell of their experiences. One 
witness said this "thing" had gone right over her car and that she had pulled 
to the side of the road, shaking. A male caller described it also as about 50 
feet long.  Many said that it hovered overhead and then suddenly disappeared. 
Robert E. Hagadorn, a Ridgefield resident in another state stated he saw lights 
overhead, going parallel to Route 84 East.  He was driving on Route 84 at the 
inter-section of the Taconic Parkway in New York about 8 p.m. the same evening, 
one hour before Greenwich residents sighting.

disappeared over the hills.  Both stated they observed a helicopter, which 
seemed to be almost tailing the object.  They stated they spotted the lights 
while heading toward the city on Boulevard.  The object was a "flat cylinder" 
with the bot-tom and top lights brighter than those running down the center,

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Multicolored UFO's the side of ping-pong balls 
were seen in the skies over Brazil on Monday, and the government sent fighter 
jets to chase them, the air force minister said on television. 
 
Because they saturated our radar system in Sao Paulo and because they were 
interfering with air traffic, it was decided to send up planes to pursue them, 
Brigadier Gen. Otavio Moreira lima said yesterday. 
 
The air force immediately dispatched four fighter jets - two Mirages and two F-
5s - to find the flying objects, which the Air Space Defense Center had located 
over the cities of Sao Paulo, Sao Jose dos Campos and Rio de Janeiro. 
 
One of the F-5 pilots reported seeing objects that he said were multicolored, 
Moreira Lima said. adding, He reported that 13 of these objects accompanied his 
aircraft.  Another pilot described the objects as the shape and side of a ping-
pong ball flying at a speed of (840 mph) a leading news network, reported. 
 
The jets, which also picked up the UFOs on their radar screens, tracked them 
for almost three hours, but had to turn back when the planes started to run out 
of fuel. I can't give an explanation for this because we don't have any, said 
Moreira Lima.

PETALUMA, Calif. More then a dozen people reported seeing an unidentified 
flying object hovering and darting over this suburban city north of San 
Francisco early yesterday morning. 
 
I looked up and saw seveal orange lights hovering in the sky, said Sue Heart, 
who was delivering newspapers at 4:30 a.m. when the UFO was sighted. 
 
A California Highway patrolman described the fast flying object as a large, 
orange X with white lights on the front.  
 
All witnesses agreed it was not an airplane, and air-traffic and military 
spokesmen in the area were unable to explain the object. 
 
The sighting came three days after Brazilian air-force jets reportedly chased 
more then a dozen fast-moving objects marked by intense green, red and white 
lights.
