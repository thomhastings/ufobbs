THE GALLUP POLL                        FOR RELEASE: Thursday, March 12, 1987Only One-Third of Public Deny Existence of UFOs, Extraterrestrial LifePrinceton, NJ-- For millions of American adults a "Close Encounter of the Third Kind" is a distinct possibility, with only about one in three flatly denying the existence of either unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or extraterrestrial life.    In a new Gallup survey, 50% express the belief that there are "people somewhat like ourselves living on other planets in the universe", while 34% are skeptical and 16% are unsure. The current figures are virtually unchanged from those recorded in a 1978 survey, but considerably more now than in either 1973 or 1966 believe in extraterrestrial life.    Similarly, 49% of those who have heard or read about UFOs think they are real, while 30% are doubtful and 21% uncertain. Belief in UFOs is down slightly from its peak in 1978, when 57% thought they were real.    9% Report Sighting UFO    In the new survey, one person in 11 (9%) reports actually having seen something he or she thought was a UFO, statistically similar to the findings of earlier polls.    Belief Higher Among College-Educated    Belief in the existence of life on other planets and in UFOs is substantially higher among persons who attended college than among those whose formal education ended at or before graduation from high school.    Men are more likely than women to believe in extraterrestrail life, 62% and 40%, respectively, but men and women share the same opinions about UFOs.    As a rule, people 50 and older are less convinced than their juniors that either phenomenon has a basis in fact, but more older than younger adults are undecided. Westerners are most apt to be believers; Southerners, least so.    Following are the questions, the trends and the latest findings among key demographic groups:    Respondents were first asked:    HAVE YOU HEARD OR READ ABOUT UFOS (UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS)?    Those answering affirmatively (88% of the total) were then asked:    HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING YOU THOUGHT WAS A UFO?Sighting of UFO (based on aware groups)1987               9%1978               91973              111966               5    IN YOUR OPINION, ARE UFOS SOMETHING REAL OR JUST PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION?Existence of UFOs(based on aware groups)                   Real    Imaginary         Not Sure1987               49        30                  211978               57        27                  161973               54        30                  161966               46        29                  25Existence of UFOs(based on aware groups)                   Real    Imaginary         Not SureNATIONAL           49        30                  21Men                50        31                  19Women              49        28                  23Attended College   56        26                  18No College         44        33                  2318-29 Years        53        32                  1530-49 Years        57        21                  2250 & Older         36        39                  25East               52        30                  18Midwest            48        27                  25South              39        39                  22West               62        19                  19All persons in the survey were asked the following question:    DO YOU THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE SOMEWHAT LIKE OURSELVES    LIVING ON OTHER PLANETS IN THE UNIVERSE, OR NOT?Extraterrestrial Life                 Yes        No       Not Sure1987               50        34        161978               51        33        161973               46        38        161966               34        46        20Extraterrestrial Life                  Yes        No     Not SureNATIONAL           50        34       16Men                62        30        8Women              40        28       32Attended College   57        33       10 No College         46        35       1918-29 Years        52        36       1230-49 Years        56        35        950 & Older         42        33       25 East               55        29       16Midwest            49        34       17South              38        48       14West               63        21       16    The latest findings are based on telephone interviews with 527 adults, 18 and older, conducted in scientifically selected localities across the nation during the period Feb 2-18. For results based on samples of this size, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects could be 6 percentage points in either direction.    In addition to sampling error, the reader should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls. These statements conform to the standards of disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.
