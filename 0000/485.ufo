Residents in this rural town along the Tennessee Kentucky border say an 
unidentified object hovered over a local softball game and has made several 
other appearances in the past week. 
 
The craft was first sighted by about 200 people at the softball game on 
Tuesday, said Donaid Napier, publisher of the local newspaper. The Clay 
Citizen. 
 
It was making just a deafening noise...Out on the field, the umpires, the 
pitcher, the batter and everybody just stoped what they were doing and  just 
looked straight up.  It got everybody's attention, Napier said.  Witnesses said 
the object was 250 to 300 feet long, with an octagonal shape at least four 
outside lights and a beacon at the center.  It looked just exactly like a jet 
plane and sounded like it was going to crash.  It was going down at about a 45 
degree angle right toward the river, he sais. 
 
Clay County Sheriff's Department officals said they have had numerous calls 
about reported sighting since Tuesday.  Dwight Goolsby, owner of a local 
restaurant said he saw the craft, It had one big white light spotlight-like on 
each side shining down on the ground. He said you could see real good on the 
ground. It was just sitting there, then it eased off over the horizon. 
 
Melba Burch, of the Chamber of Commerce, said the craft passed over her home.  
It sounded mighty darn low. She said my husband's worked around planes and I've 
been around planes all my life.  This wasn't any light plane that came over my 
house.

Witness stated he didn't see any figure, he couldn't make it out.  What he saw 
was a bright light, an amber colored light up about 40 - 50,000 feet at about 
9:00 p.m.  He saw it for about 2 1/2 minutes.  Another witness saw the last 20 
- 30 seconds of it.  The night was crystal clear and the light was moving real 
fast, incredibly fast, faster than a fighter leaving a vapor trail.  He was 
really amazed by maneuvers it made and the remarkable turns it made.  It was 
above them for a while.  Made maneuvers half a dozen times.  Some were pure 90 
degree turns.  Seemed to slow down and stop a little, hesitate and then move 
and make a turn.  Made zigzags.  First came from north and went south then went 
west and hovered then moved few zigzags and then as it came towards then it 
made really sharp turn then headed back toward west and out of sight.  
Maintained the same color the whole time.

things, very quick.  It first zigzaged coming from north then went east stopped 
and came towards him then bolted west then east and west again and disappeared.  
He went in the house and told his wife and when they came back outside there 
were two jet con trails that apparently were following the same thing.  Tryed 
locally to find out what it was but was unsuccessful.  Very sharp maneuvers and 
felt that it could out maneuver any jet.

A number of cars on US route 119 observed what they thought was an aircraft 
coming down out of the sky and looked like it was going to make a crash landing 
in the middle of the highway.  Cars coming from both directions observed it.  
It had green lights, six to eight lights, larger than normal navigational 
lights, none flashing.  Observed for 30-40 seconds then from each direction 
there was like a bend coming around and right at the spot where they lost sight 
of it.  When they all came around the bend the hillside was on fire indicating 
that it had crashed on a real steep embankment.  People stopped on both sides 
of the road to climb up the embankment to put out the fire thinking that an 
airplane had crashed, but there was no crash and the object just disappeared.  
There was a nine foot diameter fire on top of the hill.  The report went into 
Emergency Service as an airplane crash.  They went up on the hill the next day 
and found two burnt circles, samples have been taken and are presently at the 
lab.  What was unusual about it was the fire was put out very quickly but after 
15 hours of the incident the area where the fire had been still had warm stones 
but outside that area the stones were cold.  One witness was coming from 
California and was an air traffic controller.  He stated he would sign a 
statement stating that what he saw was not a conventional aircraft and it was 
double tiered object with eight to ten green lights and whatever it was was not 
a normal aircraft.

Prosperity Road, at 4:30 a.m. today when he saw an orange light in the sky, 
"that was the size of a grapefruit and darted about like a hummingbird for 
about 10 to 15 seconds, then disappeared." 
 
Taylor, 55, of 1030 Cornell Drive, reported the sighting to Lima's John

The light was in the northwest, apparently some 200 feet above the ground, and

contact him in writing at P.O. Box 1621, Lima.

WIKIEUP - The Arizona Department of Public Safety said the people were sober 
and on their way to, not from, Las Vegas.  The motorists reported an an other-
worldly light on the western horizon followed their car as they traveled toward 
Las Vegas shortly before dawn Thursday. 
 
However, an expert on heavenly bodies said later Thursday that the light 
probably was nothing more than the planet Mars. 
 
A member of a group that compiles reports of UFO sightings does not agree. 
 
At this point, officers of the DPS don't really care what it was.  They are 
tired of all the hoopla. 
 
A motorist, who DPS spokesman Alan Schmidt said wants to remain anonymous, told 
an officer that she, another adult and her two sons were driving to Las Vegas, 
Nev., on U.S. 93 early Thursday when she and her sons spotted a strange orange 
light that hovered above the western horizon and appeared to follow the car as 
it traveled north. 
 
The object was said to "pulsate like a star" and was described as appearing 
"about twice as bright and twice as big as a star."  
 
Patrolman Veronica Minch, Schmidt said, had spotted the object earlier. 
 
"She thought little of it and went on about her business," Schmidt said. 
 
"Meanwhile, down the road, these people see it." 
 
The DPS phoned Nellis Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, "to see if any rockets or 
balloons had been launched," Schmidt said.  "They said they had no activity 
like that."
