      a.  All persons aware of the contents or existence of a MERINT  
report are governed by the Commincations Act of 1934 and amendments   
thereto, and Espionage Laws.  MERINT reports contain information affect-   
ing the National Defense of the United States within the meaning of the    
Espionage Laws, 18 U.S. Code, 793 and 794.  The unauthorized transmission  
or revelation of the contents of MERINT reports in any manner is pro- 
hibited.  
 
      b.  Military commands and activities in making local distribution    
of MERINT reports and in subsequent communications regarding the contents  
of any MERINT report shall handle such communications in accordance with   
current security regulations. 
 
402.  EXAMPLES BY TYPE   
 
      The following are examples of the types of "MERINT" reports.    
Specific application of Military or commercial procedure has been avoided  
since the means of transmission would determine the procedure to be used.  
Of primary importance is the expeditious handling and accuracy of the 
reports.
