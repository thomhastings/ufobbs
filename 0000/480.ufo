white light moving real fast towards her.  She said: It dove down and it 
flipped on its side, she said: A grayish, diamond -shaped outline blended in 
with the sky but appeared to be about 25 feet long, she said: In the middld of 
the object, hovering silently at the height of a telephone pole, was an intense 
light surrounded by two green lights and two red lights.  A large strobe light 
falling from the sky was the way Mrs. Ward, of 1017 Chatum Court, described her 
sighting she observed a pulsating light dropped down in the area or vicinity of

Nassau County police sais: Last night, the unidentified object moving across 
the evening skies was a blimp.  But then again, the Federal Aviation 
Administration and the port Authority police said: It was a prank by small 
planes flying in formation.  More then two dozen Nassau residents phoned 
newsday last night to report a strange, slient object with blinking lights 
crossing north by northeast over Valley Stream, West Hempstead, Garden City, 
New Hyde Park, Westbury and Port Wasgington. Leslie Gross reported that she and 
her husband were in Manhasset about 8:30 p.m. when they saw an object like a 
kite....moving slowly through the sky.  There were white and red lights 
flashing on and off.  It was a seven-dot configuration.  Then it changed from a 
triangular shape to an oval shape. It was quite large.It was low enough so that 
If it was a plane, you would have heard the motor.  After South Shore precincts 
received more then 50 telephoned queries a car was dispat- ched to the 
Hempstead area about 8:45 p.m.  Officers Paul Scheibelein and Robert Schiller 
of the Fifth Precinct identified the object as a blimp.  They said: They could 
see the oval shape and identify the runing lights.  Port Authority police and 
the FAA said: The UFO was probably four or five small planes flying in 
formation.

object. She said: It was as large as a house and had a yellow halo. Mrs.Bagby 
said: She felt a tingling sensation during the experience that night of Nov 10, 
as if she had been out in the sun to long. Mrs.  Bagby called the sheriff 
department but they just "laughed".So I really haven't said that much about it. 
She said: It makes you feel so alone. But four other people living near 
Lincolnton said: They saw a Saturn-shaped object that maneuvered near their 
homes for about 30 minutes on May 1, frightening animals and causing power 
failures and telephone interfe-rence.  They said: It vibrated their house,cast 
a beam  of light on one of them and gave off a heat wave. Two other witnesses a

vertically with a very slight horizontal component rela-tive to himself, in

but rather blinked out.  He said: It seemed to be describing an Eastward 
trajectory in its descent. The witnesses vehicle was moving at approximately 30

Oct 17, several Wilton residents in the Danbury and Grumman Hill road area 
phoned Wilton police with sighting of strange red lights. The lights hovered at 
treetop level for four to five minutes, started to move slowly and then 
disappeared.  June Dober of Crosswicks Ridge said: She and her son on Thursday 
night both sew a huge, hovering object which looked like a spaceship. It flew 
low in the sky but didn't make any noise, she said. About the same time that 
night a man asked not to be identified said: He sew a strange light in the sky. 
Apparently, other people sew it too, he said, because several cars traveling 
north on Route 7 pulled over to the shoulder for a look at the sky. Early 
Thursday evening, Mellissa Lorentson of Grumman Avenue reported having seen 
stra- nge red lights moving at treetop level in a Northwest direction. The 
witness said: The lights were very disti-nct, with no form and were moving very 
slowly . Lisa Sforza a reporter with The Danbury News-Times said: She was out 
the field on an assignment on Thursday night when she saw a strange, V shaped 
red lights move silently through the night sky.

The following was posted to ParaNet on the 22 of March. ParaNet is a computer

 --------------------------------------------

I am also in question as to a phenomenon I observed about three weeks ago.  It 
was about 8:30 pm and looking out my window, I noticed a white light in the 
sky. I watched for several minutes as the lights grew dim, and brightened 
again. It did this about 4 - 5 times per-minute.  I got a small 30 - power 
telescope that I had gotten from a friend, and watch the object for about two 
more minutes.  As I watched, the lights continued to brighten and dim.  When 
bright, it looked somewhat like viewing a spotlight from a distance of 20 
yards.  When it dimmed down, I could see no shape, but only a speck that looked 
like a dying ember. During the whole time, the object hovered, absolutely 
motionless. after about three minutes it began to move across the sky, 
apparently at high speed, although from that distance, my perception may have 
been fooled. However, it must have been moving fairly rapidly, as it moved from 
the position it was to the southeast across the sky and disappeared over the 
horizon.  Yet it moved that distance in 30 seconds. I connot estimate how far 
the UFO was from me, but it seemed to be no more than 4 - 5 miles, however, as 
I said, I could not accurately judge the distance, but it had the appearance of 
being that distance. I watch for it the following night, but it appeared 
nowhere. I cannot say what it was. At first, I thought it may be a helicopter, 
but if it was, it would not appear as a light, even if it shining an arc-
spotlight in my direction,Nor could a helicopter have move at the speed which I 
observed. If it was a jet, it would not have appeared motionless,even if it 
were flying straight as the light I saw. So as to what it was, I cannot say. 
Since that night, I have not seen the phenomena in the sky.

Frances Shaw was driving south on N.C. 226 near her home in Shelby Sunday night 
when she had a close encounter with a perfectly round orange object hovering in 
the sky. 
 
As Shaw kept driving, she said the object grew larger and the orange light it 
was emitting intensified and began blinking. Shaw, was scared and thought it 
was going to land in her front yard. 
 
Shaw, said it didn't land but disappeared just as she was pulling up to her 
house. Shaw said when the object disappeared, it left a "trail of smoke." 
 
County Sheriffs Department said three other people called, all with in 15 
minutes of each other, to report a bright light traveling west to east.

she thought it might have been a blinking light on top of a tower. But as it 
grew in size and intensity. she could tell that it wasn't.
