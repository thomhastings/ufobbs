1. On 18 October 1973 at 2305 hours in the vicinity of Mansfield, Ohio,    
Army Helicopter 68-15444 assigned to Cleveland USARFFAC encountered a near 
midair collision with a unidentified flying object. Four crewmembers  
assigned to the Cleveland USARFFAC for flying proficiency were on AFTP
status when this incident occurred. The flight crew assigned was CPT  
Lawrence J. Coyne, Pilot in Command,1LT Arrigo Jozzi, Copilot, SSG Robert  
Yanacsek, Crew Chief, SSG John Healey,Flight Medio,All the above personnel 
are member of the 316th MED DET(HEL AMB). a tenant reserve unit of the
Cleveland USARFFAC. 
 
2. The reported incident happened as follows: Army Helicopter 68-15444 was 
returning from Columbus, Ohio to Cleveland, Ohio and at 2305 hours east,   
south east of Mansfield Airport in the vicinity of Mansfield, Ohio while   
flying at an altitude of 2500 feet and on a heading of 030 degrees, SSG    
Yanacsek observed a red light on the east horizon,90 drgrees to the flight 
path of the helicopter. Approximately 30 seconds later, SSG Yanacsek  
indicated the object was converging on the helicopter at the same altitude 
at a airspeed in excess of 600 knots and on a midair collision heading.    
 
Cpt Coyne observed the converging object, took over the controls of the    
aircraft and initiated a power descent from 2500 feet to 1700 feet to 
avoid impact with the object. A radio call was initiated to Mansfield 
Tower who acknowledged the helicopter and was asked by CPT Coyne if there  
were any high performance aircraft flying in the vicinity of Mansfield
Airport however there was no response received from the tower. The crew    
expected impact from the object instead, the object was observed to   
hesistate momontarily over the helicopter and then slowly continued on a   
westerly course accelerating at a high rate of speed, clear west of   
Mansfield Airport then turn 45 degree heading to the Northwest.  
Cpt Coyne indicated the altimeter read a 1000 fpm olimp and read 3500 feet 
with the collective in the full down position. The aircraft was returned   
to 2500 feet by CPT Coyne and flown back to Cleveland, Ohio. The flight    
plan was closed and the FAA Flight Service Station notified of the    
incident.  The FSS told CPT Coyne to report the incident to the FAA GADO   
office a Cleveland Hopkins Airport Mr. Porter, 83d USARCOM was notified of 
the incident at 1530 hours on 19 Oct 73.

THAT THEY HAD SEEN STRANGE OBJECTS IN THE SKY.  SOME REPORTED A KIND OF    
BIRD-LIKE OBJECT WHILE OTHERS REPORTED A HELICOPTER WITH A LIGHT ON.  
THERE WERE NO HELICOPTERS AIRBORNE AT THAT TIME.------------------------   
------------------------- AFTER.  HE TOLD THE CITIZEN IT WAS ONLY STARS    
AND HAD TALKED TO MEHRABAD TOWER HE DECIDED TO LOOK FOR HIMSELF.  HE  
NOTICED AN OBJECT IN THE SKY SIMILAR TO A STAR BIGGER AND BRIGHTER.  HE    
DECIDED TO SCRAMBLE AN F-4 FROM SHAHROKHI AFB TO INVESTIGATE.    
 
  B.  AT 0130 HRS ON THE 19TH THE F-4 TOOK OFF AND PROCEEDED TO A POINT    
ABOUT 40 NM NORTH OF TEHRAN.  DUE TO ITS BRILLIANCE THE OBJECT WAS    
EASILY VISIBLE FROM 70 MILES AWAY.  AS THE F-4 APPROACHED A RANGE OF 25    
NH HE LOST ALL INSTRUMENTATION AND COMMUNICTIONS (UHF AND INTERCOM).  
HE BROKE OFF THE INTERCEPT AND HEADED BACK TO SHAHROKHI.  WHEN THE F-4
TURNED AWAY FROM THE OBJECT AND APPARENTLY WAS NO LONGER A THREAT TO IT    
THE AIRCRAFT REGAINED ALL INSTRUMENTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS.  AT 0140
HRS A SECOND F-4 WAS LAUNCHED.  THE BACKSEATER ACQUIRED A RADAR LOCK ON    
AT 27 NH.  12 O'CLOCK HIGH POSITION WITH THE VC (RATE OF CLOSURE) AT 150   
NHPH.  AS THE RANGE DECREASED TO 25 NH THE OBJECT MOVED AWAY AT A SPEED    
THAT WAS VISIBLE ON THE RADAR SCOPE AND STAYED AT 25 NH.    
  C.  THE SIZE OF THE RADAR RETURN WAS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF A 707 TANKER. 
THE VISUAL SIZE OF THE OBJECT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISCERN BECAUSE OF ITS 
INTENSE BRILLIANCE.  THE LIGHT THAT IT GAVE OFF WAS THAT OF FLASHING  
STROBE LIGHTS ARRANGED IN A RECTANGULAR PATTERN AND ALTERNATING BLUE- 
GREEN, RED AND ORANGE IN COLOR.  THE SEQUENCE OF THE LIGHTS WAS SO FAST    
THAT ALL THE COLORS COULD BE SEEN AT ONCE.  THE OBJECT AND THE PURSUING    
F-4 CONTINUED ON A COURSE TO THE SOUTH OF TEHRAN WHEN ANOTHER BRIGHTLY
LIGHTED OBJECT, ESTIMATED TO BE ONE HALF TO ONE THIRD THE APPARENT SIZE OF 
THE MOON, CAME OUT OF THE ORIGINAL OBJECT.  THIS SECOND OBJECT HEADED 
STRAIGHT TOWARD THE F-4 AT A VERY FAST RATE OF SPEED.  THE PILOT ATTEMPTED 
TO FIRE AN AIM-9 MISSILE AT THE OBJECT BUT AT THAT INSTANT HIS WEAPONS
CONTROL PANEL WENT OFF AND HE LOST ALL COMMUNICATIONS (UHF AND INTERPHONE) 
AT THIS POINT THE PILOT INITIATED A TURN AND NEGATIVE G DIVE TO GET AWAY.  
AS HE TURNED THE OBJEAZ FELL IN TRAIL AT WHAT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 3-4 NH. 
AS HE CONTINUED IN HIS TURN AWAY FROM THE PRIMARY OBJECT THE SECOND OBJECT 
WENT TO THE INSIDE OF HIS TURN THEN RETURNED TO THE PRIMARY OBJECT FOR A   
PERFECT REJOIN.
  D.  SHORTLY AFTER THE SECOND OBJECT JOINED UP WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECT    
ANOTHER OBJECT APPEARED TO COME OUT OF THE

OTHER SIDE OF THE PRIMARY OBJECT GOING STRAIGHT DOWN. AT A GREAT RATE OF   
SPEED.  THE F-4 CREW HAD REGAINED COMMUNICATIONS AND THE WEAPONS CONTROL   
PANEL AND WATCHED THE OBJECT APPROACH THE GROUND ANTICIPATING A LARGE 
EXPLOSION.  THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO COME TO REST GENTLY ON THE EARCH AND   
CAST A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT OVER AN AREA OF ABOUT 2-3 KILOMETERS.   
THE CREW DESCENDED FROM THEIR ALTITUDE OF 26H TO 15H AND CONTINUED TO 
OBSERVE AND MARK THE OBJECT'S POSITION.  THEY HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN  
ADJUSTING THEIR NIGHT VISIBILITY FOR LANDING SO AFTER ORBITING MEHRABAD    
A FEW TIMES THEY WENT OUT FOR A STRAIGHT IN LANDING.  THERE WAS A LOT OF   
INTERFERENCE ON THE UHF AND EACH TIME THEY PASSED THROUGH A MAG. BEARING   
OF 150 DEGREE FROM EHRABAD THEY LOST THEIR COMMUNICATIONS (UHF AND    
INTERPHONE) AND THE INS FLUCTUATED FROM 30 DEGREES - 50 DEGREES.  THE ONE  
CIVIL AIRLINER THAT WAS APPROACHING MEHRABAD DURING THIS SAME TIME    
EXPERIENCED COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE IN THE SAME VICINITY (KILO ZULU) BUT    
DID NOT REPORT SEEING ANYTHING.  WHILE THE F-4 WAS ON A LONG FINAL    
APPROACH THE CREW NOTICED ANOTHER CYLINDER SHAPED OBJECT (ABOUT THE SIZE   
OF A T-BIRD AT 10M) WITH BRIGHT STEADY LIGHTS ON EACH END AND A FLASHER    
IN THE MIDDLE.  WHEN QUERIED THE TOWER STATED THERE WAS NO OTHER KNOWN
TRAFFIC IN THE AREA.  DURING THE TIME THAT THE OBJECT PASSED OVER THE 
F-4 THE TOWER DID NOT HAVE A VISUAL ON IT BUT PICKED IT UP AFTER THE  
PILOT TOLD THEM TO LOOK BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE REFINERY.  
  E.  DURING DAYLIGHT THE F-4 CREW WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE AREA IN A
HELICOPTER WHERE THE OBJECT APPARENTLY HAD LANDED.  NOTHING WAS NOTICED    
AT THE SPOT WHERE THEY THOUGHT THE OBJECT LANDED (A DRY LAKE BED) BUT 
AS THEY CIRCLED OFF TO THE WEST OF THE AREA THEY PICKED UP A VERY
NOTICEABLE BEEPER SIGNAL.  AT THE POINT WHERE THE RETURN WAS THE 
LOUDEST WAS A SMALL HOUSE WITH A GARDEN.  THEY LANDED AND ASKED THE   
PEOPLE WITHIN IF THEY HAD NOTICED ANYTHING STRANGE LAST NIGHT.  THE   
PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT A LOUD NOISE AND A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT LIKE    
LIGHTNING.  THE AIRCRAFT AND AREA WHERE THE OBJECT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE
LANDED ARE BEING CHECKED FOR POSSIBLE RADIATION ----------------------
