 SUBJECT: A TV MOVIE PILOT ON ALTERNATIVE 3                  FILE: UFO648
 
 
 -Here's the lowdown on "ALTERNATIVE 3" from a TV-movie compendium.         "ALTERNATIVE 3" (GB 1977; 52m, colour)         Amusing spoof documentary about the diasappearance of various         high-IQ citizens, allegedly to form nucleus of a standby civilization         on Mars against the coming End of the World. Sly parodies of         fashionable breathless TV journalism sweetened the joke, ex-         newscaster Tim Brinton held it all together with po-faced gravity         and needless to say some supernature fanatics refuse to this day to         accept that it was anything but gospel truth, although it was         orignally scheduled for April 1st (1977).         Written by David Ambrose; directed by Chris Miles; for Anglia. -Apparently the TV-movie was spawned by a book (or assuming the date   is accurate, vice versa) of the same name. Written by Leslie Watkins,   it was published by Sphere Books Ltd. in 1978.
