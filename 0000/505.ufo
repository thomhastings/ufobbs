                REPORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC PANEL
                             ON                       JAN 17 1953
                 UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS




  1. Pursuant to the request of the Assistant Director for Scientific
Intelligence, the undersigned Panel of Scientific Consultants has met to 
evaluate any possible threat to national security posed by Unidentified 
Flying Objects ("Flying Saucers"), and to make recommendations thereon.
The Panel has received the evidence as presented by cognizant intelli-
gence agencies, primarily the Air Technical Intelligence Center, and has 
reviewed a selection of the best documented incidents. 

     2. As a result of its considerations, the Panel concludes:
        a. That the evidence presented on Unidentified Flying
     Objects shows no indication that these phenomena constitute
     a direct physical threat to national security.

We firmly believe that there is no residuum of cases which indicates
Phenomena which are attributable to foreign artifacts capable of hostile
acts, and that there is no evidence that the phenomena indicates a need
for the revision of current scientific concepts.

     3. The Panel further concludes:
        a. That the continued emphasis on the reporting of
     these phenomena does, in these parlous times, result in a
     threat to the orderly functioning of the protective organs
     of the body politic.

We cite as examples the clogging of channels of communication by irrelevant
reports, the danger of being led by continued false alarms to ignore real

indications of hostile action, and the cultivation of a morbid national 
psychology in which skillful hostile propaganda could induce hysterical 
behavior and harmful distrust of duty constituted authority. 

     4. In order most effectively to strengthen the national facilities
For the timely recognition and the appropriate handling of true indications
of hostile action, and to minimize the concomitant dangers alluded to
above, the Panel recommends:

          a. That the national security agencies take immediate steps
     to strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they
     have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately
     acquired;

          b. That the national security agencies institute policies
     on intelligence, training, and public education designed to prepare
     the material defenses and the morale of the country to recognize
     most promptly and to react most effectively to true indications
     of hostile intent or action.

We suggest that these aims may be achieved by an integrated program
designed to reassure the public of the total lack of evidence of Inimical
forces behind the phenomenon, to train personnel to recognize and reject
false indications quickly and effectively, and to strengthen regular
channels for the evaluation of and prompt reaction to true indications
of hostile measures.
