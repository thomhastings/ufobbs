Dear Sir: 
 
I am in receipt of your letter concerning your research on the mystery
of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and I understand that you are   
participating in an international effort to establish contact with    
persons having past experiences involving UFOs.   
 
In June 1970, I had occasion to come in direct contact with a UFO.  I was  
stationed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with the Federal Aviation Administra-  
tion (FAA) and was flying with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard.  In
the early morning, a report had been received from two air carriers;  
Pan American, and a local carrier, Caribair, that at dawn a large
balloon-like object was sighted drifting slowly southwestward at an   
approximate altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  The object was detected on   
the Air Route Traffic Control Center radar and subsequently tracked.  
Movement appeared to be in a southwesterly direction at 4 to 8 knots per   
hour, varying slightly hour to hour.  I was a member of a flight of 104s   
and a T-33 aircraft that went to the site where the object had been   
sighted to observe and to photograph it if possible.  The object was  
visible from the ground at Isla Verde Airport, San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
lying low in the skies on a south southwesterly heading.  Its appearance   
was similar to a balloon.  After becoming airborne and flying towards 
the object, it became immediately apparent that it was at a very high 
altitude and was quite a distance away.  The object was approximately 
40 miles southwest of Ponce, Puerto Rico, at an altitude in excess of 
60,000 feet, estimated roughly at 80,000 feet.  Myself in a T-33 and four  
other pilots in f104s observed and photographed the object.  The 
following details are noted:  
 
     1.  It was a manufactured item.    
 
     2.  It was at least 125 feet in width with the same approximate  
         length.    
 
     3.  It was shaped similar to the forward one-third of a speedboat
         hull with a flat rear section and a pointed nose section.    
         (See sketch.)   
 
     4.  There was an area of high reflectivity on the "keel" approxi-
         mately one-third from the nose of the object.  (See sketch.)

     5.  The object remained oriented in a northeasterly/southwesterly
         direction with the nose pointed northeast; the stern to the  
        southwest, and drifting slowly against the prevailing winds to
        the southwest about 8 knots per hour.
 
    6.  There were no signs of any type of propulsion unit on the object.  
 
Extensive gun-camera film was collected showing the object very closely.   
A B-52 from Ramey Air Force Base acquired the target on the radar.  Upon   
"locking on," the B-52 received electronic jamming.  The object was kept   
in surveillance throughout the remainder of the daylight hours and was
lost after dark.    
 
The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was clear skies and
unlimited visibility.  The object was viewed by the majority of the popu-  
lation of the island of Puerto Rico; visible in plain sight for most of    
the day, and reported to all military intelligence activities, National    
Weather Service, etc.  We have yet to receive a satisfactory explanation   
as to what the object was.  The San Juan Star published a series of   
articles concerning the incident.  
 
I am presently the Deputy Chief at the Kansas City Air Route Traffic  
Control Center and would welcome any additional inquiries on this subject  
and perhaps I could direct you to where film could be obtained of the 
object.   
 
Thank you,
 
 
CHARLES M. BUMSTEAD, Deputy Chief  
Kansas City ARTC Center

Dear Mr.________________:
 
     This is in response to your letter of October 21, 1978 
requesting information on MOONDUST AND BLUEFLY.   
 
     BLUEFLY was a project for the acquisition of airlift   
for a quick reaction capability.  It was determined that    
the need did not exist and the project was discontinued
several years ago.  
 
     MOONDUST is a program in which the Air Force provides  
technical assistance in determining the origin of space
debris, U.S. or foreign. 
 
     These programs are under the purview of Air Force Systems   
Command, Andrews AFB, MD, 20034.  Please write to the Director   
of Information there, if you desire additional data.  He    
may be able to help.
 
                              Sincerely,
 
                              ALBERT W. SCHUMANN  
                              Colonel, USAF
