REMARKS                  SUMMARY OF INFORMATION   
 
  1.  On 2 Sept 80, SOURCE related on 8 Aug 80, three Security Policemen   
assigned to 1608 SPS, KAFB, NM, on duty inside the Manzano Weapons Storage 
Area sighted an unidentified light in the air that traveled from North to  
South over the Coyote Canyon area of the Department of Defense Restricted  
Test Range on KAFB, NM.  The Security Policemen identified as:  SSGT  
STEPHEN FERENZ, Area Supervisor, ATC MARTIN W. RIST and AMN ANTHONY D.
FRAZIER, were later interviewed separately by SOURCE and all three    
related the same statement; at approximately 2350 hrs., while on duty in   
Charlie Sector, East Side of Manzano, the three observed a very bright
light in the sky approximately 3 miles North-North East of their position. 
The light traveled with great speed and stopped suddenly in the sky over   
Coyote Canyon.  The three first thought the object was a helicopter,  
however, after observing the strange aerial maneuvers (stop and go), they  
felt a helicopter couldn't have performed such skills.  The light landed   
in the Coyote Canyon area.  Sometime later, three witnessed the light take 
off and leave proceeding straight up at a high speed and disappear.   
 
  2.  Central Security Control (CSC) inside Manzano, contacted Sandia 
Security, who conducts frequent building checks on two alarmed structures  
in area.  They advised that a patrol was already in the area and would
investigate.   
 
  3.  On 11 Aug 80, RUSS CURTIS, Sandia Security, advised that on 9 Aug    
80, a Sandia Security Guard, (who wishes his name not be divulged for fear 
of harassment), related the following:  At approximately 0020 hrs., he was 
driving east on the Coyote Canyon access road on a routine building check  
of an alarmed structure.  As he approached the structure he observed a
bright light near the ground behind the structure.  He also observed an    
object he first thought was a helicopter.  But after driving closer, he    
observed a round disk shaped object.  He attempted to radio for backup
patrol but his radio would not work.  As he approached the object on foot  
armed with a shotgun, the object took off in a vertical direction at a
high rate of speed.  The guard was a former helicopter mechanic in the
U.S. Army and stated the object he observed was not a helicopter.
 
  4.  SOURCE advised on 22 Aug 80, three other security policemen observed 
the same aerial phenomena described by the first three.  Again the object  
landed in Coyote Canyon.  They did not see the object take off.

5.  Coyote Canyon is part of a large restricted test range used by the Air 
Force Weapons Laboratory, Sandia Laboratories, Defense Nuclear Agency and  
the Department of Energy.  The range was formerly patrolled by Sandia 
Security, however, they only conduct building checks there now.  
 
6.  On 10 Aug 80, a New Mexico State Patrolman sighted an aerial object    
land in the Manzano's between Belen and Albuquerque, NM.  The Patrolman    
reported the sighting to the Kirtland AFB Command Post, who later referred 
the patrolman to the AFOSI Dist 17.  AFOSI Dist 17 advised the patrolman   
to make a report through his own agency.  On 11 Aug 80, the Kirtland  
Public Information office advised the patrolman the USAF no longer    
investigates such sighting unless they occur on a USAF base.
 
7.  WRITER contacted all the agencies who utilized the test range and it   
was learned no aerial tests are conducted in the Coyote Canyon area.  Only 
ground test are conducted.    
 
8.  On 8 Sept 80, WRITER learned from Sandia Security that another    
Security guard observed a object land near an alarmed structure sometime   
during the first week of August, but did not report it until just
recently for fear of harassment.   
 
9.  The two alarmed structures located within the area contain HQ CR 44    
material.

REMARKS                    SUMMARY OF INFORMATION 
 
1.  On 13 Aug 80, 1960 COMMSq Maintenance Officer reported Radar Approach  
Control equipment and scanner radar inoperative due to high frequency 
jamming from an unknown cause.  Total blackout of entire radar approach    
system to include Albuquerque Airport was in effect between 1630-2215 hrs. 
Radar Approach Control back up system also were inoperative.
 
2.  On 13 Aug 80, Defense Nuclear Agency Radio Frequency Monitors
determined, by vector analysis, the interference was being sent from an    
area (V-90 degrees or due East).  On DAF map coordinates E-28.6.  The area 
was located NW of Coyote Canyon Test area.  It was first thought that 
Sandia Laboratory, which utilizes the test range was responsible.
However, after a careful check, it was later determined that no test were  
being conducted in the canyon area.  Department of Energy, Air Force  
Weapons Laboratory and DNA were contacted but assured that their agencies  
were not responsible.    
 
3.  On 13 Aug 80, Base Security Police conducted a physical check of the   
area but because of the mountainous terrain, a thorough check could not be 
completed at that time.  A later foot search failed to disclose anything   
that could have caused the interference.
 
4.  On 13 Aug 80, at 2216 hrs., all radar equipment returned to normal
operation without further incident.
 
5.  CONCLUSION:  The presence of hostile intelligence jamming cannot be    
ruled out.  Although no evidence would suggest this, the method has been   
used in the past.  Communication maintenance specialists cannot explain    
how such interference could cause the radar equipment to become totally    
inoperative.  Neither could they suggest the type or range of the
interference signal.  DNA frequency monitors reporeted the interference    
beam was wide spread and a type unknown to their electronical equipment.   
Further checks of the area was being conducted by Technical Services, 
AFOSI.    
 
6.  High command interest item.  Briefings requested IAW AFOSIR 124-4 be   
completed at HQ AFOSI/IVOE.  HQ CR 44 and 51 items.

Subject Case NR:  8017D93-126 HQ CR 44  
1.  Subject Negatives/Film were analyzed by HQ IVT and 7602 AINTELG, it    
and the following results were found:   
A.  Negative #1:  Deplicting C-5A aircraft on approach and streaking  
unidentified aerial object in lower right portion of film.  Film found to  
be unaltered.  Size differential was not consistent with size of aircraft. 
Conclusion:  Inconclusive
B.  Negative #2:  Deplicting cylinder shaped unidentified aerial object in 
upper left portion of photo.  Film found to be unaltered.  Film showed
object to be consistent with field depth and consistent with relative size 
of fixed objects.  Conclusion:  Legitimate negative of unidentified aerial 
object.  Bolton/Reinfeld method did not reveal visible markings on object. 
C.  Negative #3:  Deplicting irregular shaped unidentified aerial object   
in seven frames of 8MM film.  Because of the size and apparent speed of    
object no further classification or conclusion could be drawn.  Film shown 
to be unaltered.    
D.  34 inches of 8MM film:  Deplicting apparent colored object moving in   
front of still camera.  Film found to be unaltered.  Spectrography    
revealed colors to be basic prism features.  Depth analysis revealed  
object to be within 152MM of camera.  Object was not consistent with  
relative size of fixed objects observed for several seconds in film.  
Conclusion:  inconclusive.    
E.  Original Negative Deplicting Unidentified Object:  Film found to be    
unaltered.  Because of a lack of fixed objects in the film, no depth  
analysis could be performed.  Bolton, Reinfeld method revealed object to   
be saucer shaped, approximate diameter 37 feet.  Object contained a   
trilateral insignia on the lower portion of object.  Conclusion: 
Legitimate negative of unidentified aerial object.
2.  Ref your request for further information regarding HQ CR 44, the  
following is provided:  Capt. Grace 7602 Aintelg, INS contacted and   
related following:  (S/WINTEL) USAF no longer publicly active in UFO  
research, however USAF still has interest in all UFO sightings over USAF   
installation/test ranges.  Several other government agencies, lead by 
NASA, actively investigates legitimate sightings through covert cover.
(S/WINTEL/FSA)  One such cover is UFO Reporting Center, US Coast and  
Geodetic Survey, Rockville, MD 20852.  NASA filters results of sightings   
to appropriate military departments with interest in that particular  
sighting.  The official US Government Policy and results of project   
Aquarius is still classified top secret with no dissemination outside 
official intelligence channels and with restricted access to "MJ 
Twelve".  Case on Bennewitz is being monitored by NASA, INS, who 
request all future evidence be forwarded to them thru AFOSI, IVOE.    
4.  Ref your request for technical assistance.  Because of a chance of
public disclosure, no knowledgeable personnel with SPA will be provided.   
Continue to receive assistance from individuals mentioned in your
message, Miller, fugate.  Because of the sensitivity of case, request 
they be thoroughly debriefed at regualr intervals.
