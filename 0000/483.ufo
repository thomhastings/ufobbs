Witness observed 20 miles NE of Baltimore six F15 aircraft flying at a high 
altitude laying down heavy vapor trails and as they passed out of sight to the 
south he observed a small object coming from the north moving at a high rate of 
speed.  It caught up with the vapor trails and passed through them and then 
maneuvered around and started moving parallel with the vapor trails and came 
within a short distance of the F15s and made a sweeping turn at which time it 
reflected the sun and proceeded back to the north and out of sight.  Witness is 
a 66 year old retired pilot.  Observed the object for twenty seconds.  The 
object did not leave a trail and at one point it came to a complete stop while 
traveling at a high rate of speed and then started moving again instantly.

An unidentified object seen last week in this rural town along the Tennessee-
Kenutcky border was really a U.S. Army helicopter from Fort Campbell, KY, U.S. 
Rep. Bart Gordon said Wednesday. 
 
Congressman Gordon, called the U.S. Army and Air Force to investigate the UFO 
matter and he found out that it was a helicopter, said Meg McKnight, a 
spokeswoman for the Tennessee Democrat. 
 
Residents in Celina reported seeing the craft on July 8, through july 10, after 
an intial sighting by 200 people at a softball game, sais Clay County Sheriff's 
dispatcher Lisa Gail Boles. 
 
Witnesses said: the object was 250 to 300 feet long, with an octagonal shape, 
at least four outside lights and a beacon at the center. 
 
However - Capt. Randy Pullen at Fort Campbell said: the crafts are about 30 
feet long.  Major Mike Dormeyer at the Fort Campbell Army Base confirmed that 
three UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters were flying on all the nights the sightings 
were reported, Ms. McKnight said. 
 
Dormeyer said: the crafts were not easily identified because they are equipped 
with turbine engines that cover up the sound of the blades, Ms. McKnight said. 
 
The Clay County Sheriff's Department has classified the object as a plane. 
 
However, Ms. Boles said: "It wasn't a helicopter, I seen it myself," she said:" 
It was a two-engine plane that followed the same route for three nights."

Two witnesses, Dorothy and Larry Wood,  observed a green round dot with a short

observed about one tenth of a second.  The object was very high in the sky 
going west to east about five miles west of Monroe, Washington at 10:20 pm.

not believe the object to be a meteor or anything known.

Bob Manil observed what looked at first like a meteor or shooting star but went 
at different speeds and would go zigzag.  Sometimes it would come a little 
closer and get a little brighter but never close enough to let him see the 
shape only that it looked like a star.  He observed it for five minutes as it 
headed north.  One other witness also observed the light for about 30 seconds.  
Sometimes the light would come to a complete stop and then continue.
