SPACE ALIENS BROUGHT ADAM AND EVE TO EARTH TO START HUMAN RACE:


Adam and Eve were aliens brought here by UFOs to colonize Earth, according to 
researchers.

The Old Testament is an amazing history of how the aliens bred with Stone Age 
people and developed civilization, says Fuyval Abrams, and archaeologist and 
Biblical scholar.

The researcher's incredible claims include:

    1. The Garden of Eden was planted by aliens to protect Adam and Eve from                             
       wild animals and Stone Age neighbors.
        
    2. The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge were computers.

    3. The Stone Age people were intellectually and physically inferior to the 
       aliens.

    4. The children of Adam and Eve and their offspring bred with the primitive 
       humans and produced modern men.

    5. Guardian Angels were aliens and controlled our early development from a
       space ship orbiting the Earth and are still keeping watch over us.

    6. At least one of Adam's children, Enoch, and the prophets Ezekial and
       taken up to the spaceship to be studied.

    7. The light that guided the Israelites through the desert for 40 years was 
       a spaceship.

    8. The Ten Commandments were burned into the stone tablets with a laser.

    9. The Ark of the Covenant was a powerful laser weapon that helped the 
       Israelites conquer the Promised Land.

   10. Adam, Noah and others, including Abraham and Moses, talked directly with
       the space aliens.

   11. Christ was an alien. In addition to the Old Testament, Abrams and other 
       researchers also used ommentaries from the Jewish Talmud and Legends of 
       the Bible, a six volume work by Rabbi Louis Ginzberg.

Both contain a great deal of material not included in the Old Testament.

The sequence in which God created the universe and our planet Earth at the 
beginning of the book of Genesis is an accurate description of the "Big Band" 
theory favored by many scientists today, according to Abrams.

When the Lord said, Let there be light, that was the Big Bang, when a ball of 
condensed matter exploded and became the stars and planets.

Someone knew thousands of years ago how the universe was created.

Professor Helmut Roche, a French astrophysicist, claims the passage So God 
created man in His own image...(Genesis 1:27) is proof that we are genetically 
related to the aliens.

And Cain went from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on 
the east of Eden.(genesis 4:16)

Cain was banished from the Garden and had to live among the Stone Age people, 
explains Roche. Cain bred with the Stone Age females and produced the first 
modern men. Later, Adam's other offspring also bred with the original 
inhabitants of the planet.

The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took 
them wives of all which they chose. (Genesis: 6:2) Abrams, Roche and others say 
the Patriarchs, Adam's grandchildren, including Methuselah, Enoch and Noah, all 
lived long lives because they were aliens.

As the sons of God - Adam's children, Enoch and Cain, and his grandchildren, 
the Patriarchs - continued to breed with the sons of man, the alien gene pool 
eventually became diluted and the lifespan of the alien colonists decreased 
from 900 years to barely 100.

And the Lord said, My spirit will not always be with man because he is also 
flesh like the primitive humans and his days shall be 120 years. (Genesis 6:3)

After a time, the alien colonists became so morally and physically corrupted 
that God decided the alien and human hybrids had to be destroyed.

So He told Adams's grandson, Noah, to build the Ark, then the orbiting mother 
ship created a cloud cover over the planet and flooded it, Roche explains.

Darin Plunkett, a British expert, says the mother ship occasionally brought up 
someone from the Earth to see how badly the gene pool was breaking down.

Three of these were Enoch, Adams's grandson, and Ezekial and Elijah, who came a 
thousand years after the Flood. 

And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.(Genesis 5:21-24)

Enoch is the only Patriarch who did not die in Genesis, Abrams says.

God took him when he was only 365 years old, about less than half the lifespan 
of the other Patriarchs.

Other versions of Genesis say he was raised up to heaven on a pillar of cloud, 
amidst thunder, Similar ascents were ascribed to Ezekial and Elijah.

Then the spirit lifted me up, and the glory of God arose from its place, I 
heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake. (Ezekial 3:12)

In the second Book of Kings (2:11) Elisha describes Elijah's ascent into 
heaven:

And it came to pass, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, which parted 
them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

These are both pretty good descriptions of a spaceship launch, especially form 
the viewpoints of people who had never seen a spaceship, says Plunkett.

Abraham was visited several times by angels - spacemen - as were other notables 
of the Old Testament. Two angels visited Abraham on their way to destroy Sodom 
and Gomorrah (Genesis 18:2) and another when he was about to sacrifice his son 
to God, according to Roche.

The overwhelming evidence of aliens and spaceships controlling and guiding the 
destiny of the early Israelites is so plentiful that the connection between 
them becomes all too obvious, Roche says.

He cites the amazing incident described in the Book of Exodus, when the 
Israelites were wandering through the desert of Sinai as further evidence of 
UFOs in the Bible:

And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way 
and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they may go by day 
and by night: the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, 
departed not from before the people. (Exodus 13:21-22)

The pillars of cloud and fire were with the Israelites the entire 40 years they 
were in the desert, and probably knocked down the walls of Jericho with some 
sort of sound vibrator, says Roche.

The Ten Commandments were written on stone tablets with some sort of laser 
beam, Abrams says.

Hew thee two tablets of some like unto the first and I will write upon these 
tablets the words that were in the first tablets, which thou breakest. Exdous 
34:1

The experts also believe the Star of Bethlehem was a spaceship that landed 
Jesus, and infant spaceman, on Earth and later picked him up after he arose 
from the dead.

Roche says a statement in a commentary on Exodus and not included in the Bible 
promised:

My angels will be with man until the end of his days.
