Holbrook, Ariz. - A group of 21 space aliens has landed and taken refuge in the 
heart of the Petrified Forest National Park - and they're asking President 
Clinton to let them remain here as U.S. citizens!

The came to Earth to escape religious persecution on their own planet, says 
attorney Betty Montell, who represents the extraterrestrial immigrants. And 
they've settled here in America because of our reputation as the great melting 
pot.

Although their technology is light years ahead of our own, the government on 
their home planet is tyrannical and cruel. They've come hoping to build a new 
life here in the land of the free.

And I'm acting as their counsel.

So far we've had two visits with President Clinton, but nothing has been 
decided yet.

Mrs. Montell, who retired from her law practice and moved here in 1988, will 
not reveal the exact location where the aliens wait, hoping against hope that 
the government will grant them political asylum. But their settlement is 
somewhere in the Petrified Forest, north of the Zuni Indian Reservation.

Mrs. Montell is determined to win them the right to stay here. But she's not 
without her critics.

We have enough freeloaders flooding our shores, says one Arizona state 
government official.

Why should hardworking Americans be asked to pick up the tab for yet another 
group of maladjusted outsiders?

But Mrs. Montell calls the criticisms unfair and biased.

These beings are intelligent, well behaved and law aiding, the lawyer told 
reporters. And unlike some others who are seeking U.S. citizenship, they speak 
perfect English.

They'll be useful productive citizens who will add to, not detract from, 
American society.

Some experts foresee serious psychological problems for the refugees themselves 
if Clinton okays their request.

The difficulties of integrating themselves into our culture will put great 
stress on them, says a therapist who has interviewed the alien delegation.

They may know our monetary system, how to speak English and drive cars, and how 
to alter their bodies to digest our food. But their entire lives have been 
spent in a totally different world. It will take them five or six generations 
to adapt.

President Clinton has not commented on the situation. But Washington sources 
expect a decision by early July.
